# Factory Reset

## Overview

The OpenBMC API defines a factory reset interface, which is intended to be used
to restore the BMC to its original manufacturer settings. This interface is
defined generically; it is specifically and variously implemented throughout
OpenBMC services, which allows these services to be individually restored to
factory defaults as needed.
