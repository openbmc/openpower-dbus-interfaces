          This is a bit mask used to specify clearing different security keys
          or resetting those values back to default by the host. Setting this
          property does not guarantee a successful operation as additional
          conditions will be checked by the host to clear/reset the sensitive
          data.

          The new property is having an integer value and the default value will
          be zero. The end operation is determined by the bit value set and some
          of the customer use cases include
          a) Clear/reset all sensitive data
          b) Clear OS platform keys
          c) Reset the system key back to its default state

          An external user should be able to update the value using ipmitool.
