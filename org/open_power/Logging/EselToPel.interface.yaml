    Implement this interface to represent an error log in PEL format.

    An example app implementing this interface watches for error logs created
    by phosphor-looging app in the BMC and then creates new objects with the
    same path as phosphor-logging. The new objects will implement the PEL
    interface, the app will convert an eSEL to PEL in text format,if found
    in the original log. This allows a REST server to get the PEL properties of
    a log as well when queried for a log in the BMC,since both the
    phosphor-logging and openpower-logging properties are combined together.

properties:
    - name: PEL
      type: string
